                "The crew loading and the crew unloading were competent, friendly and knowledgeable. I moved on the cusp of the coronavirus pandemic, and even with those added pressures, all involved did an excellent job."
            </p>



            <p class="review-comment">
                They went above and beyond my expectations in almost every way. Given this move happened during a national emergency of COVID-19 outbreak, it was super impressive that it felt like my needs were being prioritized.
            </p>



            <p class="review-comment">Both loading and unloading were great, especially given the current conditions and uncertainty of the coronavirus. All aspects of the move went on without a hitch. </p>
